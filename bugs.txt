scrolling surface quickly which causes the mouse to go over an element fires the surface leave event which stops scrolling.

create circles within circles.  Since the mouse leave doesn't fire for a particular circle, we only get the anchor points for the outer circle.

Why do I get "a is not defined" when I move parseTransform into helpers?

fixed: moving a shape quickly on the surface messes up the anchor translation
fixed: multiple loads doesn't work (the file is already loaded, so it does nothing)
fixed: double event trigger on mouse down on shape after load (but only 2, never more)
fixed: shapes (even new ones dropped) can't be dragged after load
fixed: after load, scrolling surface translates surface but not objects on surface
fixed: inspect the svg element, why is the width and height so large?  string/int concat issue?
